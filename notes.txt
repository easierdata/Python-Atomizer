Objective: 

Take a python workflow and atomize program & module functions into IPFS CIDs such that the workflow 
can be replicated on another environment without the need of installing libraries


Static Workflow
-----------------
Part I:
1. Traverse through inputs directory & subdirectories
2. Parse files by line
3. Find the beginning of each function
4. For each function, find the next line where the character is != white-space
5. Dump that range into a file 

Part II:
1. Name each file their respective function names
2. Upload to IPFS
3. Dump all CIDs to a file
 
Part III:
1. Add to JSON the references of other functions/CIDs

Profiled Workflow
-------------------
Part I:
1. Execute python program in cProfile: python -m cProfile -o program.prof my_program.py
2. Operate program as necessary
3. Dump recorded workflow into a file

Part II:
1. Parse workflow, and extract functions according to location in workflow
2. Put functions in respective files <- This will be tricky because it should execute like normal (will
have to point the programs to one another)

Part III:
1. CAR output and put to IPFS or upload each atomized function to IPFS
